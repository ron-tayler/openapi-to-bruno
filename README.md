# OPENAPI-TO-BRUNO

this is a simple cli tool to convert an openapi file to a bruno collection. code is 99% copied from the [bruno project](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno).

Code is taken from release 1.22.0 of bruno, very possible it will break in the future.

error handling is virtually non-existent, your own responsibility etc.

## Usage

```bash
openapi-to-bruno generate <path-to-openapi-file> <path-to-output-directory>
```
